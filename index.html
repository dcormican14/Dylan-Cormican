      <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
        <img src="./img/seniorphoto.jpg" alt="seniorphoto">
        <p>I am currently a student enrolled in Colorado School of Mines and majoring in Computer Science with an emphasis in data science.
        As for my experiences regarding computer science, I have learned many programming and other languages, including Java, Python, C++, HTML, CSS and Linux, during my time here at Mines.
        Not only that, but I am also a PATHS scholar at Mines, meaning I am a part of a computer science honors program. </p>
        <p>For the future, my hopes are to work at an inclusive company that is looking to make a difference in the world and one that pushes new technologies.
        I have always found new innovations exciting and to work at a business that agrees with me would be a dream come true.</p>
        <p>Beyond school, I have always enjoyed a good cup of coffee, throwing on some music and sitting down to play a fun board game with some friends. On the weekends, you can always
        catch me going on a hike or a bike ride to enjoy the sunny days here in Colorado.</p>

      <h2>Some of My History</h2>
        <img src="./img/southtable.jpg" alt="southtable">
        <p class = "beginning-past">I was born and raised in the small mountain town of Fraser, Colorado. There, I attended Middle Park High School. While there was not a lot to do,
        I was always finding ways to stay busy. From earning my Eagle Scout award to becoming an ordained elder in the Presbyterian faith, I constantly
        did something other than the basic high school experience.</p>
        <p>I believe that this drive and motivation has followed me into college and beyond, and I have always tried to surpass the minumum.
        In that aspect, the computer science world suits me well, as there is so much that is able to be done and infinite possibilities to be explored.</p>
