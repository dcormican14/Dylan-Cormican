                  <p>This side project went from a small inquiry to a massive
                  undertaking as I became more and more interested in how to
                  send data over a network. Essentially, I was able to access
                  multiple Raspberry Pis, and the intention was to use real-time
                  data to analyze what is happening in a room.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Naturally, the project appeared to be a simple one, but after
                  doing some research and scouring some docs, I figured out that
                  my goal was slightly more difficult than I had first thought.
                  Despite the challenge, I was still able to write two classes
                  for each of the Pis to run in the terminal. My client class
                  used Pythonâ€™s socket and pickle libraries to turn the dictionary
                  into a byte stream and send it to the corresponding server
                  class, which was set up to listen on the network and decrypt
                  the received data. Once that was finished, I sent some data
                  over our home internet to one of the Pis, and that Pi was able
                  to run some calculations on the data. </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>While being a more intensive project than intended, I enjoyed
                  every minute of it and was excited to see some programming that
                  I made interact with the world. </p>

                  <div class="underline"></div>
                  <p>Safety NET is a web application that allows first responders
                  at Colorado School of Mines to communicate with students and
                  professors on campus, and it is designed to be implemented on
                  top of the existing Mines alert system for ease of use. The
                  program is essentially a map generation tool that first
                  responders can use, in the event of an emergency, to warn
                  students of where to avoid and where safe areas are on campus.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Even though this project was developed for a class at CSM, my
                  colleagues and I truly went above and beyond expectations
                  with the implementation of our design. We spent many hours
                  researching web development, URL generation, campus maps,
                  and talking to stakeholders to arrive at our solution, and
                  at the end of the semester, our hard work was rewarded with
                  the satisfaction of earning first place in our section during
                  the design competition.</p>

                  <div class="underline"></div>
                  <p>After learning about cryptocurrencies and investing, I
                  became curious about implementing a trading bot that would
                  look at real-world market data and purchase/sell coins and
                  stocks based on an analysis of the incoming data.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Crypto bot is a simple program that looks at certain markers
                  like moving averages and support lines and attempts to time
                  market trades. Naturally, for real-time data, I had to tie
                  into a web API and access some data from the FTX exchange
                  and other cryptocurrency exchanges. This was the largest
                  part of the project, as I have never used an API before,
                  but they are certainly useful, and there may be more projects
                  involving APIs to come. </p>
