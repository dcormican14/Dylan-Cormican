                  <p>I am pleased to announce that I have been accepted onto the
                  Poly team for the summer as a software development intern.
                  I am enthusiastic to be working with code in an industry
                  setting and excited to meet my peers who will be participating
                  in the internship with me. More updates on my time at Poly
                  will be sure to follow.</p>

                  <div class="underline"></div>
                  <p>This post marks the completion of my year-long undergraduate
                  research opportunity under my graduate mentor, Hoon Seo.
                  Throughout the course of the year, I was truly able to learn
                  and experience the world of neural networks and machine learning.
                  In addition, I feel as though this involvement educated me on
                  several industry practices and professional standards that I
                  would not have learned in the coursework of CSM alone. </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>The research involved taking drilling data from a real-world
                  company and turning it into a 3-dimensional model of the ore
                  deposits underground. The algorithm we used was called a
                  Generative Adversarial Imputation Network, or GAIN. Essentially,
                  this model takes a handful of data points and fills in the
                  gaps with estimations of what the true values would be. Then,
                  to test the data, the model looks at the output and attempts
                  to discern which values were estimations. If it guesses
                  incorrectly, that means the model is working, but if it finds
                  the generated values, then the program will attempt the
                  estimations again.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>I am grateful to the Mines Undergraduate Research Fellowship
                  for this experience, and I will make the most use of what I
                  learned in my future computer science applications and projects.</p>

                  <p>At MPEI, I was able to stretch my computer science legs and
                  experience what the professional tech world would be like.
                  As this was my first Internship, I am grateful to Mountain
                  Parks for hiring me and teaching me about IT and server
                  management.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>While on the job, I was assigned to various tasks, including
                  the implementation of duo security for remote workers, writing
                  onboarding scripts for new machines, and upgrading the companyâ€™s
                  meeting room, among other things.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Even though this position was primarily in the world of IT,
                  I learned a great deal that I have been able to apply to my
                  studies and other involvements.</p>
