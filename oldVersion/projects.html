      <h2>About Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
      <img src="./img/tictactoe.png" alt="tictactoepic">
      <p>This is my first major project at Colorado School of Mines. The program allows the user to play a game against a second player, or against
      some gaming logic that I have designed. While the concept is rudamentory, The application uses recursion and simple algorithms to function,
      making it slightly more interesting than your average text-based game.</p>
      <p>To run it, you can find my files on my GitHub under the "TicTacToe" repository, and you can run it with PyCharm or a similar text editor.</p>

      <h2>Mountain Parks Electric Internship</h2>
      <img src="./img/MPEI.jpg" alt="MPEI">
      <p>Here, I had my first real world tech experience outide of Colorado School of Mines. I helped the company as an intern for the IT department.
      From day one, I was working on learning and applying various concepts such as onboarding scripting, server management, helpdesk tasks, security
      implementation and more.</p>
      <p>The two main contributions I made to the company at my time there involved Duo Security and onboard scripting. By the time my three months there
      were up, I had the opportunity to research wich two factor authentication method was the best and most accessible in the industry, and I began the
      implementation process for the office. Secondly, I contributed to the team by writing an onboarding script for them that took all of the necessary
      application softwares and loaded them on to the computer with the correct specifications. This greatly increased productivity by reducing the new
      computer setup time from about two hours to roughly twenty minutes.</p>
      <p>All in all, I had a great time at Mountain Parks, and I learned so much in the field of information technologies.</p>

      <h2>About Crypto Bot</h2>
      <img src="./img/crypto.jpg" alt="tictactoepic">
      <p>After learning about cryptocurrencies and investing, I decided to build an autonomous crypto trading bot. It is a simple program
      that uses Python Websockets and the FTX exchange API to determine when to invest in the market and when to take out the money. Through this project,
      I learned how web APIs work and how to tie into them with personal code.</p>
      <p>I will be uploading the code to GitHub when I clean it up and remove my personal information from it.</p>
