                    Today marks a significant milestone as I celebrate six months working as a software development intern at HP. The
                    experience has been transformative, and I am proud of the knowledge I've gained in front-end web development and Windows
                    application development during my time here. As my internship nears its conclusion, I am eager to seize every
                    opportunity to learn even more.

                  <p>
                    One of the standout aspects of this internship has been the incredible culture and welcoming atmosphere at HP. From day
                    one, I felt embraced by the friendly team, and the inclusive environment made me feel right at home. This positive and
                    supportive culture has undoubtedly contributed to the richness of my experience, and I am genuinely grateful for the
                    opportunity to be a part of it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All in all, my time at HP has been nothing short of great, and I am thankful for the valuable experiences and skills
                    I've acquired. As I prepare to conclude my internship, I look forward to applying everything I've learned and continuing
                    to grow in my software development journey.

                    I am thrilled to report that my experience at Poly exceeded all my expectations. It provided a remarkable opportunity to
                    deepen my knowledge of Python and enhance my teamwork skills, which I consider invaluable assets.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    The main project assigned to our team of four interns was to load test the Poly Lens platform, ensuring its resilience
                    and uncovering any existing errors. We achieved this by meticulously designing testing scenarios that could trigger
                    various reactions in the system. Python played a central role in the entire process, from creating automated testing
                    scenarios to generating unique messages and devices while collecting data seamlessly. This automation enabled the system
                    to operate on servers, allowing for extensive data collection without the need for constant user interaction.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    Moreover, after successfully completing the project, we took on another task of data entry to support a smooth HP
                    acquisition. Rather than manually entering the data, we recognized the potential for automation. Within two days, we
                    developed and implemented an automated system for data entry, ensuring accuracy and significantly speeding up the
                    process. Our initiative saved the company numerous work hours. I even had the opportunity to train a full-time employee
                    to use the program effectively for future data entries.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    In total, our efforts collectively saved Poly several hundred hours of work across a team of eight individuals. It was
                    incredibly satisfying to contribute to the company's efficiency and growth.

                    summer! This opportunity brings me immense enthusiasm as I embark on a journey of working with real-world code in an
                    industry setting.

                    This post signifies the successful culmination of my year-long undergraduate research opportunity under the guidance of
                    my graduate mentor, Hoon Seo. Throughout this enriching journey, I immersed myself in the fascinating world of neural
                    networks and machine learning, gaining invaluable hands-on experience.

                    The research focused on transforming drilling data from a real-world company into a comprehensive 3-dimensional
                    model of underground ore deposits. Our approach involved implementing a Generative Adversarial Imputation Network (GAIN)
                    algorithm. This sophisticated model filled gaps in the data with estimations of true values, and subsequently conducted
                    testing to verify the accuracy of the generated data. If the process detected a distinct difference between actual values
                    and estimations, the model was refined and improved until there were no differences discernable.
