                  <div class="underline"></div>
                  <p>As a follow-up to my previous post, I can confirm That
                   working at Poly was everything I had anticipated and more.
                   Not only did I learn about how to work on a team more
                   effectively, but I also delved deeper into python than I
                   have ever been able to in school.</p>
                     <br>
                  <p>The project that our team of four interns was tasked
                    with was to load test the Poly Lens platform to generate
                    rigidity and expose any errors in the existing system. We
                    achieved this by creating testing scenarios that would cause
                    the system to react differently than its base state and
                    observing the way it reacts. The system was created and
                    developed in Python, and the generation of testing scenarios,
                    creation of unique messages and devices, and collection of data
                    were automated to reduce user interactions. This will
                    allow for the system to run on servers for more data to be
                    collected without the necessity of a user present.</p>
                    <br>
                  <p>In addition, after we had completed the project, we were
                    tasked with data entry to ensure the HP acquisition went smoothly.
                    One other intern and I decided that the entry could be
                    automated rather than hand created. This would ensure
                    correctness moving forward and more rapid input of data. We
                    created the system in two days and ran it on the remaining hundred
                    entries, saving the company several work hours. In addition,
                    I was able to train another full-time employee on how to run
                    the program so they could use it on an incoming thousand entries
                    that would arrive after we left. In all, we were able to save Poly
                    several hundred hours spread across a team of eight individuals.</p>

                  <p>I am pleased to announce that I have been accepted onto the
                  Poly team for the summer as a software development intern.
                  I am enthusiastic to be working with code in an industry
                  setting and excited to meet my peers who will be participating
                  in the internship with me. More updates on my time at Poly
                  will be sure to follow.</p>

                  <div class="underline"></div>
                  <p>This post marks the completion of my year-long undergraduate
                  research opportunity under my graduate mentor, Hoon Seo.
                  Throughout the course of the year, I was truly able to learn
                  and experience the world of neural networks and machine learning.
                  In addition, I feel as though this involvement educated me on
                  several industry practices and professional standards that I
                  would not have learned in the coursework of CSM alone. </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>The research involved taking drilling data from a real-world
                  company and turning it into a 3-dimensional model of the ore
                  deposits underground. The algorithm we used was called a
                  Generative Adversarial Imputation Network, or GAIN. Essentially,
                  this model takes a handful of data points and fills in the
                  gaps with estimations of what the true values would be. Then,
                  to test the data, the model looks at the output and attempts
                  to discern which values were estimations. If it guesses
                  incorrectly, that means the model is working, but if it finds
                  the generated values, then the program will attempt the
                  estimations again.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>I am grateful to the Mines Undergraduate Research Fellowship
                  for this experience, and I will make the most use of what I
                  learned in my future computer science applications and projects.</p>

                  <p>At MPEI, I was able to stretch my computer science legs and
                  experience what the professional tech world would be like.
                  As this was my first Internship, I am grateful to Mountain
                  Parks for hiring me and teaching me about IT and server
                  management.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>While on the job, I was assigned to various tasks, including
                  the implementation of duo security for remote workers, writing
                  onboarding scripts for new machines, and upgrading the companyâ€™s
                  meeting room, among other things.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Even though this position was primarily in the world of IT,
                  I learned a great deal that I have been able to apply to my
                  studies and other involvements.</p>
